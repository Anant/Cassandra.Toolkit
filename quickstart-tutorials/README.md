# Quickstart Tutorials
## Purpose
These directories contain sample docker containers, docker-compose files, instructions and configs to quickly get setup with toy projects for development or testing. 

These projects are not directly related to cassandra.toolkit and are not required, although some can be used alongside the clusters that you create using cassandra.toolkit.

# Table of Contents
- [dse-on-docker](./dse-on-docker)
A simple docker-compose.yml file to get dse up and running quickly over docker with some reasonable defaults.

- [spark-cluster-on-docker](./spark-cluster-on-docker)
A quick way to get a three "node" spark cluster running locally for development. Starter scripts, instructions, and docker-compose.yml file all come included. 

- [stargate](./stargate)
Instructions and sample configs to quickly get started with Stargate, the Cassandra REST API for Cassandra.
