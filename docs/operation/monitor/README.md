# Cluster Monitoring

There are two types of monitoring: online monitoring and offline monitoring. Online monitoring refers to live monitoring on an active cluster, which allows you to keep track of what is happening as it happens. Offline monitoring is when you do not have the ability to setup live monitoring, but you do have access to a diagnostic tarball, which you can use to diagnose issues or see how your cluster is doing overall.

See more on each type of monitoring by following the links below.
