### Cassandra.Vision Offline Monitoring

The main documentation for offline Cassandra monitoring is found in a separate repo, [Cassandra.vision](https://github.com/Anant/cassandra.vision).

But here, we will discuss how offline monitoring fits within the overall scope of Cassandra cluster maintenance.

Note that Filebeat, Elasticsearch, and Kibana can also be used for online (live) monitoring. [Click here](./maintenance.live-monitoring.md#live-monitoring-with-filebeat-elasticsearch-and-kibana) for documentation on online monitoring with Filebeat, Elasticsearch, and Kibana.
